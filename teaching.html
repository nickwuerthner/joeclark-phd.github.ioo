<h3>Teaching</h3>

<p>I enjoy sharing what I know, and have held a variety of teaching positions.  The first, in 2001, was teaching English to preschool children in rural Taiwan; since then I've had opportunities to teach students of every age in five countries and taught information systems at four major universities: China Agricultural University, the University of Southern California, Arizona State University, and the University of Maine.</p>

Selected course offerings:
<ul>
  <li><strong>BUA101: Introduction to Business</strong> at UMaine.  A survey of several knowledge areas in economics and management for new and prospective business majors.</li>
  <li><strong>BUA235: Information Systems and Technology for Business</strong> at UMaine.  Discover the importance of information systems and the possibilities they create for business.</li>
  <li><strong>CIS440: Systems Design and E-Commerce</strong> at ASU.  An innovative <a href="https://joeclark.svbtle.com/a-capstone-course-in-information-systems">capstone course</a> in information systems featuring design thinking and Agile project management taught in a "flipped classroom" approach.</li>
  <li><strong>CIS355: Business Data Warehouses and Dimensional Modeling</strong> at ASU.  A complete re-think of the undergraduate "database" course for Analytics majors, this course covered the fundamentals of data engineering, relational databases in the context of other possible data models, and Python tools for data wrangling.</li>
  <li><strong>GSBA556: Business Models for Interactive Digital Media &amp; Services</strong> with Omar El Sawy at USC. An MBA course that explored the landscape of "digital business models" made possible by disruptive information technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Teaching Materials</h3>

<p>Some of the materials I've created for my own teaching may be useful to others, so I've tried to make them available in formats that make sense, including one textbook (with another on the way), two teaching cases and some tutorials.  Please let me know if you find these useful or have constructive feedback!  I also have teaching notes and lesson plans: <a href="mailto:joe.clark@maine.edu">email me</a>!</p>
